Explanation of the System and Its Objectives 

 

The presented system is a microcontroller-based device that uses an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to detect and track a moving object. It is designed for applications requiring precise tracking or detection in environments where the distance to an object is a key factor. 

Main Objectives: 

Accurate Distance Measurement: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object. 

 

Object Tracking: Adjusts the position of a servo motor to center the detected object. 

 

Interactivity: Allows the user to manually set a target distance using a push button. 

 

Adaptability: Handles lateral movements of the object using a scanning system.
